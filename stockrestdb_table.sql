(1, 'The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 (stylized as Samsung Galaxy Note10) is a line of Android-based phablets designed, developed, produced, and marketed by Samsung Electronics as part of the Samsung Galaxy Note series. They were unveiled on 7 August 2019, as the successors to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9.[2] Details about the phablets were widely leaked in the months leading up to the phablets\' announcement.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 2020, a midrange variant, the Galaxy Note10 Lite, was introduced with lesser specifications and features.\r\n\r\n<b>Hardware</b>\r\nThe Galaxy Note 10 line comprises three models with various hardware specifications; Note 10 and Note 10+/ Note 10+ 5G feature 6.3-inch 1080p and 6.8-inch 1440p \"Dynamic AMOLED\" displays with HDR10+ support and \"dynamic tone mapping\" technology respectively. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device. The phablet also features a 19:9 aspect ratio. The front-facing cameras occupy a rounded cut-out on the top of the display, and all models utilize an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint reader.[4][5]\r\n\r\nInternational models of the Note 10 utilize the Exynos 9825 system-on-chip, while the U.S., South American (Except Brazil) and Chinese models utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. All models are sold with 256 GB of internal Universal Flash Storage 3.0,[6] with the Note 10+ & Note 10+ 5G also being sold in a 512 GB model and offering expandable storage via a microSD card. They respectively contain 3500 and 4300 mAh batteries, with both variants supporting a 25 watt Super Fast Charging, while the Note 10+ also supports 45 watt Super Fast Charging 2.0, Qi inductive charging, and the ability to charge other Qi-compatible devices from their battery power.[7][8] The Note 10 and Note 10+ are the first mainstream Samsung smartphones to omit the 3.5 mm headphone jack.[6] The sleep/wake power button that used to be on the right side of the phone has been removed, consolidated with the Bixby button on the left side of the phone. New settings have been added that allow the button to be remapped as either a power button or a Bixby button.[9]\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, the Note 10 Lite was released. It is a midrange variant of the Note 10, containing the same cameras as the main variant. It features 128 GB of expandable storage, a 6.7 inch 1080p screen on a metallic frame, a 4,500 mAh battery and powered by Exynos 9810. The variant eliminates the wireless charging feature and stereo speakers, though it retains the 25 watt Super Fast Charging of the main series, and also has a headphone jack.\r\n\r\n<b>Camera</b>\r\nThe Note 10 series features a multi-lens rear-facing camera setup with Samsung\'s Scene Optimizer technology. It houses a dual-aperture 12-megapixel wide-angle lens, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens with the Note 10+/ Note 10+ 5G having an additional VGA Depth Vision Camera allowing for 3D AR mapping. The front-facing camera on all models consists of a 10-megapixel punch hole lens in the top center of the display. The camera software includes a new \"Shot Suggestion\" feature to assist users, \"Artistic Live Filters\", as well as the ability to post directly to Instagram posts and stories. It also contains the \"Scene Optimizer\" feature from previous Samsung phones that automatically adjusts the camera settings based on different scenes.[10][11] Both sets of cameras support 4K video recording and HDR10+ with more advanced video stabilization. There is also Live Focus Video enabling users to capture Bokeh backgrounds in video, much like with Portrait Mode.', 'Samsung Note 10', '98390389304894', 3, '40000.00', '2019-08-21', 'samsung_note10.jpg', 'electornic', 1),

The P30 Pro has a curved screen, and replaces the traditional earpiece speaker with an \"electromagnetic levitation\" speaker that vibrates the top of the phone\'s screen, enabling a narrower bezel. The P30 has IP53 water and dustproofing, while the P30 Pro has IP68, but does not include a headphone jack. Both models utilise the Kirin 980 system-on-chip. The devices feature an in-screen optical fingerprint reader, stated to have improved performance over that of the Mate 20 Pro.[1][2]\r\n\r\nIn September 2019, Huawei unveiled new \"Mystic Blue\" and \"Misty Lavender\" color finishes for the P30 Pro, which carry a two-tone appearance using matte and glossy finishes.[3]', 'Huawei P30 Pro', '88649752659757', 25, '32500.00', '2019-08-18', 'huawei_p30.jpg', 'electronic', 1),

(4, 'Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by PepsiCo. Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad\'s Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola in 1898,[1] and then shortened to Pepsi in 1961.\r\n\r\nPepsi was first introduced as \"Brad\'s Drink\"[1] in New Bern, North Carolina, United States, in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold. It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the Greek word for \"digestion\" (πέψη, pronounced the same as Pepsi), which the drink was purported to aid, and \"cola\" after the kola nut. The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla.[1] Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original stylized Pepsi-Cola wordmark used from 1898 until 1905.\r\nIn 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer Barney Oldfield was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi-Cola, describing it as \"A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race.\" The advertising theme \"Delicious and Healthful\" was then used over the next two decades.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nA 1919 newspaper ad for Pepsi-Cola\r\nIn 1923, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcy—in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark.[1] Megargel was unsuccessful in efforts to find funding to revive the brand and soon Pepsi\'s assets were purchased by Charles Guth, the president of Loft, Inc. Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace Coca-Cola at his stores\' fountains after the Coca-Cola Company refused to give him additional discounts on syrup. Guth then had Loft\'s chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula.[3]', 'Pepsi', '78545955898', 55, '15.00', '0000-00-00', 'pepsi.jpg', 'drink', 1),

(6, 'In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.\r\n\r\nFruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world\'s agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.\r\n\r\nIn common language usage, \"fruit\" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, \"fruit\" includes many structures that are not commonly called \"fruits\", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.[2][3] The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.[4]', 'Tipco น้ำองุ่นแดง', '8851013797980', 10, '20.00', '0000-00-00', 'tipco.jpg', 'drink', 1),

It was first developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone (\"Clear Lemon Fanta\") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up.\r\n\r\nSprite advertising often makes use of the portmanteau word lymon, a combination of the words \"lemon\" and \"lime\".[1]\r\n\r\nBy the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. \"I Like the Sprite In You\" was the brand\'s first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Sprite revamped their marketing logo, and slogan, as well. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging, and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver \"splashes\" and subtle white \"bubbles\" in the background. The product name, \"Sprite\" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; \"Great Lymon Taste!\" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well.', 'Sprite', '8851959135365', 30, '8.00', '0000-00-00', 'sprite.jpg', 'drink', 1),
